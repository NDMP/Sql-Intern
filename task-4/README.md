College Student Portal 

This project demonstrates how to analyze relational database data using aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses in SQL.
The dataset models a collegeâ€™s academic environment, including departments, students, courses, faculty, and marks records.

Objectives
Apply aggregate functions on academic numeric data (e.g., marks, counts).

Use GROUP BY to categorize records by department, course, or student.

Filter grouped results using HAVING for conditional aggregations.

Gain the ability to summarize and analyze real-world educational datasets.

Sample Data
Tables involved:

Department (department_id, department_name)

Student (student_id, name, email, department_id)

Course (course_id, course_name, department_id)

Faculty (faculty_id, name, course_id)

Marks (mark_id, student_id, course_id, marks, grade)
