#College Student Portal 

This project demonstrates how to analyze relational data using aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses in SQL.
The dataset models a collegeâ€™s academic structure, including departments, students, courses, faculty, and marks records.

#Objectives

Apply aggregate functions on numeric academic data (e.g., marks, counts).

Use GROUP BY to categorize results by department, course, or student.

Filter grouped results using HAVING for conditions on aggregated data.

Gain the ability to summarize and analyze real-world educational datasets.

#Sample Data

###Tables involved:

Department (department_id, department_name)

Student (student_id, name, email, department_id)

Course (course_id, course_name, department_id)

Faculty (faculty_id, name, course_id)

Marks (mark_id, student_id, course_id, marks, grade)
