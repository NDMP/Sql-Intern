This project demonstrates how to analyze relational database data using **aggregate functions**, **GROUP BY**, and **HAVING** clauses in SQL.
The dataset models a collegeâ€™s academic environment, including departments, students, courses, faculty, and marks records.

---

## **Objectives**

* Apply **aggregate functions** on academic numeric data (e.g., marks, counts).
* Use **GROUP BY** to categorize records by department, course, or student.
* Filter grouped results using **HAVING** for conditional aggregations.
* Gain the ability to **summarize and analyze** real-world educational datasets.
